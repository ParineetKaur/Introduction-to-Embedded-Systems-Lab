# Introduction-to-Embedded-Systems-Lab

## About This Repository 
The repository compiles projects and assignments from my Introduction to Embedded Systems course, which covered the following concepts: CPU, registers, buses, memory, I/O interfaces, number systems (arithmetic and information representation), assembly language programming (addressing techniques, arithmetic and logic operations, branching and looping, stack operations, procedure calls, parameter passing). 

## Learning Outcomes
1. Perform number base conversions, integer arithmetic, specify range and precision, and detect overflow in signed and unsigned fixed-point number systems.
2. Use efficient special-case alternatives for fixed and floating-point arithmetic computations, leveraging an in-depth understanding of binary arithmetic and number representations.
3. Write functions in assembly optimized for speed, memory, or both, by applying knowledge of instruction representation, instruction pipelining, and memory alignment.
4. Use assembly language's bit manipulation features to test, insert, extract, and modify bit fields within packed representations.
